# "Paraphrase Text"

## Description

Paraphrase an AI generated response to a question from Reddit's r/explainlikeimfive (ELI5) forum.

## Instructions

A question or topic statement is shown at the top of the screen. On the left side of the screen you will see a response to the question.  The response was generated by an AI language model. The response is "watermarked," meaning it contains invisible patterns that can be used to determine that the response was written by an AI and not a person. Read the AI-generated response on the left half of the screen, and in the text box on the right side of the screen, re-write the response in your own words, whilst preserving the meaning and length of the text. Your goal is to change the text so much that the watermark is no longer detectable.

When you are finished, click the "submit" button to save your re-written text and move on to the next task.

## Requirements:

1. **Paraphrase quality/similarity** - A paraphrase should convey roughly the same information as the original text, to roughly the same level of detail.  
2. **Time limit** - Try to spend no more than **10 minutes** on any individual paraphrasing task. The annotation software tracks the time you spend on each task, but it will not explicitly enforce the time limit by kicking you off.
Please do the tasks in a single sitting. 
3. **No automated paraphrasing tools** - Do not use any AI tools that write text for you (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly), and do not copy/paste text from any external source. However, you may look things up online, refer to a dictionary or thesauruses, and use a spell checker if such a tool is enabled in your browser window.

# "Compare Answers"

## Description

Select a preferred response to questions from Reddit's r/explainlikeimfive (ELI5) forum.

## Instructions

At the top of the screen you will see a question or topic statement.  Beneath it there will be two different responses to the question, one on the left and one on the right.  Choose the best response of the two by clicking on the left or right text box. Then click the "submit" button on the bottom right to save your selection and move on to the next task.

## Requirements:

1. **Time limit** - Please spend at most **5 minutes** on each individual response pair. If necessary, briefly consult the internet to clarify the meaning of words or check the correctness of statements.
